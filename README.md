### Hi there! My name is Anton, I'm a junior data engineer from Kazakhstan
I successfully worked in financial sector for 10 years and then decided to change my career and dive into the world of data.
The journey began in 2021 when I joined [DataQuest](dataquest.io) on the "Data scientist in Python" career track. I studied Python, SQL, statistics, calculus, linear algebra, visualization concepts and basic ML algorithms. While studying I made more than 20 projects to apply theoretical knowledge on practice.

After graduating I found it interesting to dive deeper into data management - how data is collected, transformed and stored. I found a [course](https://karpov.courses/dataengineer) about data engineering made by the data professionals from top russian companies such as Yandex, Mail.ru, Sber. I started studiyng there in April, 2022. It was very intensive 5 months and I learned about the various types of databases, cloud technologies, big data, data modelling, ETL processes and became very excited about it.

Now I assume I have a wide range of basic knowledge in the world of data and ready to apply it on the real world problems. You can see my data science and data engineering projests in their respective folders
